# cdsv

### A simple android app to convert your mixes and albums into a quick, stylish list.

(This app is NOT ready for actual use, it's just a quick project to practice my skills and learn more about mobile development)

cdsv is an easy-to-use app that lets you save your playlists, albums and mixes in a simple .csv file, accessible from the app itself. The app asks the user for the list's metadata and the song information, so it's easy to export it into a simple file for different utilities, like YouTube playlists or CD labels (which was the original purpose of the app!).

The iconography and UI is mostly inspired by older geometric designs, formerly used on cutting-edge type album covers.

## Features

- Save various lists
- View them all from a stylish main menu
- (β) Set a color for the list
- (β) Listen to the songs by just clicking on them!
- (α) Import songs directly from YouTube (using intents)

\*Warning: some of these features, marked in alpha (α) and beta (β) are not fully available in the app, and are being worked on for future versions.

\*Warning 2: this is purely spaghetti code
